21Apr2025: Start to work in the original game to create a MARL algorithm. 
01May2025: Create a new simplified game v02 whee I implement latest game with empty chamber cards. 
An idea that I have is to create an agent that records history of play with an lstm and shares the hidden output to the agents so they know where they are positioned. This in addition of an LSTM for each actor and critic. 
Maybe I can implement this agent later on. I implement the first MARL solution in MARL v1. 
I was able to create the env by now. I have to train the agents now.
